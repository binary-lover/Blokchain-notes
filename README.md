# Blockchain

## Description
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset. It is a chain of blocks that contain data, with each block containing a hash of the previous block. The data in a block cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority. This makes blockchain secure and tamper-proof.
